The following document outlines the plan or approach to undertaking the project:

Step 1: Information Gathering: Get Yahoo Finance Data for ASX20 Stocks, and for the period of last 10 years. The information will be stored in Dataframes.
Step 2: Information Gathering: Use Quandl for getting Reserve Bank of Australia Interest (Lending) Rates 
Step 3: 3.1: Information Gathering: Build a UI (using a Python Package) for entering input paramters such as weights, and the amount of investment.
        3.2: FOr consideration in future: if the stock symbol is a user input / or pre determined by the team.
Step 4: Processing: 1) Build the Montecarlo simulation for the next 10 years return
        Processing: 2) Build Efficient Frontier suggested weighting and use Montecarlo to simulate for the next 10 years return
        Processing: 3) Build what investment return would look like based on bank's interest rate
        Processing: 4) Compare outcomes of 3 scenarios modelled
Step 5: Output - Visual Graphs:
        <TBC. 6-8 graphs are required at a minimum for project completion>
