Team name: Yahooooo!
Members: Chris Chan, Shanshan Zhang, Sreenivas Kalva, Cuong Phan, Hemal

Project Objective: Yahooooo! team project will undertake a portfolio assessment of 4 portfolio scenarios and provides a recommendation based on higher ROI. 
We will assume that the user initial capital is A$10K, and based on 10-year historial returns will project his investment return in the next 10-years.

•	Portfolio 1: User creates his/her own ASX stock portfolio. The user will be able to select stock tickers.
•	Portfolio 2: Algorithm optimised stock portfolio (using python package EfficientXXXXXXXXXXXX)
•	Portfolio 3: (What if) User decides to not invest but benefit from bank provided interest rates. In this scenario, we will use RBA cash rates and add 1% for getting the savings rate
•	Portfolio 4: Crypto Asset - If the user invested wants to invest $10K in Crypto (ETH/BTC) equally… and project invesement value in 10-years based on 10 years historical ROI
